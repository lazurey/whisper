# React Scaffolding

This project is set up for my own react practise.

I'm get rid of setting up this once and once again every time I try to start a new demo.

## Tech Stack

- nodejs
- gulp
- React/Browserify/Stylus
- And this supports ES6 and older.

## Set up

- `npm install`
- Keep `gulp dev` and `node index.js` running at two windows.

Project is running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
